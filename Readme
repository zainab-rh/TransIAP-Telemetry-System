# TransIAP: Distributed Real-Time Telemetry System

**TransIAP** is a robust, event-driven integration platform built to ingest and process real-time GPS telemetry from a heterogeneous transport fleet. This project implements a decoupled architecture using **RabbitMQ** to normalize data from legacy (CSV), standard (XML/KML), and modern (GeoJSON) tracking devices into a unified system of record.



## System Architecture
The system is built as a set of independent, interoperable Java services:

* **Ingestion Layer**: Three independent producers simulate device telemetry in **CSV**, **KML**, and **GeoJSON** formats.
* **Intelligent Routing**: A **Topic Exchange** (`transiap.gps`) performs selective protocol filtering based on specific Routing Keys such as `gps.kml`, `gps.json`, and `gps.formato.csv`.
* **Enrichment Middleware**: A central processor normalizes inputs and performs synchronous **REST calls** to the SNTN API to append mandatory security authorization keys and official timestamps.
* **Broadcast & Monitoring**: Processed data is published via a **Fanout Exchange** (`traslados.localizaciones`), enabling simultaneous, real-time broadcasting to database persistence and terminal auditing modules without logical coupling.

## Technical Stack
* **Core**: Java 8+ (utilizing `amqp-client-4.0.2` for industrial-grade messaging).
* **Messaging**: RabbitMQ (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol).
* **API Integration**: RESTful communication for data enrichment (auth keys/timestamps).
* **Automation**: PowerShell for full-stack orchestration and environment management.
* **Persistence**: MySQL integrated via a custom DAO (Data Access Object) layer.

## Engineering Highlights
* **Full Lifecycle Ownership**: Developed the entire distributed environment, including 6 distinct functional modules (Generators, Middleware, Registry, and Visualizer), complex messaging exchanges, and database schemas.
* **DevOps Automation**: Authored a professional orchestration script (`LanzarSistema.ps1`) that manages service synchronization with safety pauses and utilizes the **Windows User32 API** to automatically organize console windows into a pre-configured monitoring grid.
* **Asynchronous Reliability**: Implemented Java `CountDownLatch` for robust thread management and specific error-handling routines to prevent system failure during REST API connection drops.
